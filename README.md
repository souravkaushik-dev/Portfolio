# Profile

Hello! I’m Sourav Kaushik, a passionate and dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from Amity University Online. With a strong foundation in computer science, I have developed a deep interest in the fields of cybersecurity, app development, and reverse engineering. I am a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), and my passion for uncovering hidden vulnerabilities has driven me to continuously push the boundaries of my knowledge in the rapidly evolving IT landscape.

Throughout my journey, I have had the opportunity to explore various facets of cybersecurity, including scanning websites for vulnerabilities, identifying weaknesses, and providing detailed reports. These vulnerability assessments have led to the discovery of significant bugs, all of which are meticulously documented and accessible via my portfolio. I believe in the importance of thorough documentation, and I strive to provide actionable insights in my reports to help organizations enhance their security posture.

In addition to vulnerability scanning, I am deeply committed to the art of reverse engineering. I have reverse-engineered numerous popular software applications, gaining invaluable insights into their inner workings. This process has sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills, allowing me to dissect complex systems, uncover flaws, and understand the intricate mechanisms that drive software functionalities.

My journey so far has included reverse engineering prominent software applications like TLauncher, as well as identifying and reporting bugs across various websites. Each of these experiences has not only enhanced my technical skills but also strengthened my ability to approach challenges with a hacker’s mindset—anticipating potential vulnerabilities and crafting solutions to address them.

Whether it's app development, bug hunting, or reverse engineering, my goal is to continuously expand my expertise and contribute meaningfully to the cybersecurity and development communities. You can explore all my vulnerability reports and reverse engineering projects through my portfolio, where I showcase detailed analyses of each project I've worked on.

I am committed to becoming one of the top bug hunters in the industry and am always excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals. If you're looking for someone with a blend of app development skills, cybersecurity expertise, and a deep understanding of software internals, I would love to connect and explore how we can work together.
